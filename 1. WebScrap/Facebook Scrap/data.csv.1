Give my kidneys to one who depends on a machine to exist from week to week. Take my bones, every muscle, every fiber and nerve in my body and find a way to make a crippled child walk. If you must bury something, let it be my faults, my weaknesses, and all prejudice against my fellow man. If, by chance, you wish to remember me, do it with a kind deed or word to someone who needs you. If you do all I have asked, I will live forever. -- Robert N. Test #DonateLife",,16,

14,"Aug 20, 2016","…were it not for the supply of donated blood and the skill of the surgical team, my lasting memory of Emma would have been that of her on that trolley, alone, scared, having barely felt the touch of the baby she carried all those months as I stood there helpless, telling her ""it'll be alright"". Emma and I are forever indebted to blood donors and Emma now gives her time willingly as an advocate for blood donation. It's because of blood donation that Emma survived her injuries and went on to have our second child, Victoria Rose. So effectively, those donors who gave their blood not only saved a life, they helped create one too. That selflessness must never be understated.

Scientists needed a way to turn this reaction off, and in Harrison's blood, they found it: a rare antibody known as Rh (D) immune globulin or anti-D. Doctors believe Harrison has anti-D because of the blood he received at age 14. And so Harrison became the first anti-D donor in Australia — and the most prolific. He's in the Guinness Book of World Records and known at home as ""the man with the golden arm."" http://www.wnyc.org/story/man-with-the-golden-arm-donates-blood-thats-saved-2-million-babies/",,,
